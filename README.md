## Subject

We need to create a third-party service to list user's Github repositories.

So, the process is:

    You log in to Github
    You log in to our service with Github account
    It shows a list of all your repositories, your avatar, and username on the same page


See for [details](https://github.com/wemake-services/meta/issues/7)
